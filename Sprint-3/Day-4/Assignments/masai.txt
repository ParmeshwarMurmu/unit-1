I joined massai because i didnt have a better resume. My batch was 2018-2022 i have wasted my time during lockdown no studies.
So i was not getting shortlisted in any of the tech company. i saw an add of masasi and there where i came to know about masai.
My experence im masai was very good because of it criculllum and the routine they follow.
Now i am in unit 1 and the journey has now started till now my ecperience was quite good;
